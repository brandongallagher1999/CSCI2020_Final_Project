##Description:
- Uses database and GUI to create an employee/buisiness management software.


##How to run:
- No extra libraries or programs required
- Use gradle file to compile classes


##Side Notes:
- The program connects to a remote PostgreSQL database that runs 24/7 so that can be used for database entry.
- Change the String URL line in database.java to connect to a seperate database.

PostgreSQL is used to create the database and hold employee records
